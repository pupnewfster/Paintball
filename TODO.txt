TODO list we thought of in that skype chat

p.setFoodLevel(20);
xp doesnt empty at end and neither does amo bar on left
auto joining from sign or commandblock
Colors, and team spectatorism
scoreboard on right
possibly a leave command for leaving game
sending you to true spawn when you leave or server stops
on death of like cactus or falling send to team spawn not server spawn
also have it remove from queue when you leave the game....
also the way to get more bullets chests or signs or from killing people some bullets
also when one whole team leaves game to have other team win
