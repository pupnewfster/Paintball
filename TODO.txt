TODO list of things we thought of

also when one whole team leaves game to have other team win or teams balance

Fix shotgun

Cvar system -- half done
traceline functions

Multiple weps in hotbar
redo/New reloading method

1. Better kill messages
2. Redo weapon specs
3. Multiple weapons
4. Left click on weapon to reload
6. Dedicated gun for one hit minute or at least same delay between shots
"ticks alive for" as a weapon spec which determines how long a snowball is alive for (kinda like range)
Classes

Make only pistol in one hit minute or some new gun
Ability to change gun mid round without leaving and then it will just give
Make the prices actually require money and add a way to get money
Add sound for taking damage
Make number of kills scale with number of players
Make a sort of AI for bots for when no one is online
Better spawning system
Make it so the worlds auto load/unload rather than using necessities to just make sure world is loaded
Given we are using bungeecord, we should just use multiple servers instead of multiple games per server. So make it so autojoin and once changing weapons ingame works... remove /leave
Add a way when there is not enough people on so that you can choose to be on the same friend or on opposite team as your friends
